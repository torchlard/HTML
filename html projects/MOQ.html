				<li>Where in the house should I keep Molecule?</li>
				<p>You can keep your Molekule anywhere in your home, but studies have shown that you can maximize the effect of an air purifier by placing it close to your bedside at night. This is known as the 'sleep breathing zone'. The air you breath at night while sleeping is critical to helping you wake up refreshed and ready to go in the mornings.</p>
				<li>Does it come in different colors?</li>
				<p>Currently Molekule only comes in the color shown on our website.</p>
				<li>What's in the box?</li>
				<p>Molekuleâ€™s air purifier ships with one nano-filter and pre-filter already installed inside the device. It also includes a power cable and handle.</p>
				<li>Will I need bluetooth or wifi to operate the unit?</li>
				<p>The device can operate independent of the Bluetooth and WiFi connection, however it is recommended to enable smart filter replacement and remote control.</p>
				<li>In what environments does Molekule work?</li>
				<p>Molekule works indoors to ensure the best possible air quality. While you can run your Molekule anywhere in the house, we recommend one device per 600 square feet. This helps to ensure that the air is properly mixing in your room and that the device is able to quickly and efficiently clean all of the air in the room.</p>

			<ul class="faq-questions">
				<li>How do I know if I need an air purifier?</li>
				<p>Air quality is an issue that can effect everyone, not just those who suffer from allergies and asthma. However, for people who suffer from allergies and asthma, the quality of the air can have a very immediate impact on your health and how you feel. Even for those who do not have allergies or asthma, studies have shown a wide variety of health issues can be caused by poor air quality. This includes things like fatigue, headaches, congestion, nasuea, dizziness, and sneezing. In today's modern buildings we often find gaseous chemicals that are carcinogenic: VOCs. These can not only be harmful in the short term, but can have risks for your long term health as well. Evaluate your symptoms and if you can the air quality of your building. If it doesn't feel right, you may need an air purifier.</p>
				<li>How bad is air pollution?</li>
				<p>The EPA states that indoor air can be up to 5 times and in some cases even 100 times worse than the outdoors. In our IAQ white paper, we detail the results of a number of health studies done on the affects of indoor air pollution and human health. See here for more: http://molekule.com/news#white-papers</p>
				<li>How can outdoor pollution affect the air quality indoors?</li>
				<p>Air handling systems pull in pollutants from the outdoors, once indoors these pollutants can easily get trapped. In fact, the more we seal our homes (to be more energy efficient) the more likely pollutants are to get trapped. This is why in many cases, indoor air can be up to 5 times and in some cases even 100 times worse than the outdoors.</p>
